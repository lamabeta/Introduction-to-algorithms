### Problem

The effect of the method of storing it on the programâ€™s performance

### Implementation
Enhance the algorithm of the given code to improve its efficiency and optimize its performance ([add your code here](https://github.com/lamabeta/Introduction-to-algorithms/blob/main/PrintEvenNumbers.java))
 ```java
public class PrintEvenNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 1;
        while (number <= 100) {
            if (number % 2 == 0) {
                System.out.println(number);
            }
            number++;
        }
    }
}
```
